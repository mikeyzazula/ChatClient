2.I think everything is in working condition, no big bugs at least. There was an issue if a client would disconnect when entering their username would cause the server to crash (it was expecting a name, got a "name" of length 0, then tried to index  out of bounds elsewhere), but that's been fixed. I was getting messages without the first character for way too long because I never adjusted my read to read the first TWO bytes initially for the uint_16t. That was pretty silly. Looking back I really should have made a "check for observers" function...Would probably have came in handy. Given more time I would implement that.
3. First I got my server in a somewhat working condition, tried to get a message from the participant, made sure that worked. Then tried to connect multiple particpants, get message from both... and just kinda work my way up from there following along the PDF. Eventually, worked everything out. 
4. As mentioned in part 2, I was stuck on the reading messages for way too long...which was only challenging because I made it challenging. Other than that, I stumbled on some memory issues here and there, but really, once I figured out the messaging issue, it was pretty much smooth(ish) sailing.
